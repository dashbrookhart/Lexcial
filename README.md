## About
This Text Semantic Similarity App uses a trained Natural Language Processing model to determine if two text entry answers are semantically the same. The idea for this app started in an attempt to solve a common problem we saw for professors in our Data Science program of trying to grade text answers. Grading manually is a hassle, and any current text autograder simply do not work. This product lets teachers spend more energy teaching and less time grading.


## The result
[Open the demo app!](https://share.streamlit.io/shahv1057/lexical_demo/main/st_lexical.py)

Enter in a text value to represent the Correct answer to the question and compare with various student answers to obtain a similarity score!
