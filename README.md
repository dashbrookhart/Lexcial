## About
This Text Semantic Similarity App uses a trained Natural Language Processing model to determine if two text entry answers are semantically the same. The idea for this app started in an attempt to solve a common problem we saw for professors in our Data Science program of trying to grade text answers. Grading manually is a hassle, and any current text autograder simply do not work. This product lets teachers spend more energy teaching and less time grading.

## Coming Soon

The ability to load in a csv file full of student inputs and compare to a correct solution to automatically grade a text entry question!
