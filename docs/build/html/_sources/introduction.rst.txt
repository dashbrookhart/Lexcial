Introduction
=================================
This Text Semantic Similarity App uses a trained Natural Language Processing
model to determine if two text entry answers are semantically the same. The idea for this app started in an attempt to solve a common problem we saw for professors in our Data Science program of trying to grade text answers. Grading manually is a hassle, and any current text autograder simply do not work. This product lets teachers spend more energy teaching and less time grading.
